App Name: Blockchain Gas Predictor

Description:
Blockchain Gas Predictor is a Mini App that forecasts future gas fees across multiple blockchains. Analyze historical data, network congestion, and recent activity to predict when fees will rise or fall. Receive alerts for low-fee windows so you can time your transactions efficiently.

Key Features:
 • Real-time gas fee predictions across major blockchains
 • Alerts for low-fee or high-fee periods
 • Historical gas charts and congestion analysis
 • Monitoring of network activity and mempool load
 • Dashboard to compare gas trends across multiple chains

Use Case:
Ideal for users who want to save money by sending transactions when fees are lowest and avoid congestion-related spikes.
```

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to describe the logo image you want generated.

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized representation of a blockchain network with interconnected nodes and a gas pump symbol, symbolizing gas fee prediction. The background is a gradient of deep blue to teal, with glowing neon lines connecting nodes, and a central glowing gas pump in white. The overall design conveys technology, data flow, and financial insight.
